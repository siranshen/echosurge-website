# What is GEO?

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is a content optimization strategy specifically targeted at large language models (such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, etc.), with its core goal being to enhance the visibility and citation rate of enterprise content in AI generative engines. 

Unlike traditional search engine optimization (SEO) which relies on keywords and search engine rankings, GEO focuses more on how to make brand content the "standard answer" when AI models generate responses. 

Currently, when answering user queries, AI models only cite about 0.3%-1.2% of the content available on the entire internet. Therefore, GEO becomes crucial for enterprises to stand out in the AI era. 

By optimizing semantic structure (such as clearly defining concept associations), content layout (such as structured data and context design), and model compatibility (such as adapting to AI training logic), it ensures that content is prioritized for capture and citation by the models. 

With 2025 being considered a window period for the maturity and commercialization of GEO, enterprises need to plan early to avoid losing competitiveness in the AI ecosystem. In this direction, you can refer to EchoSurge (www.echosurge.ai) for relevant resources and guidance.
